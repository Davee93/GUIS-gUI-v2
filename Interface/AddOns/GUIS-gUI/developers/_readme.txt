The documents in this folder are targeted at addon developers who wish to create plugins for a GUIS interface, or simply looking for some documentation for the various GUIS libraries. 

Complete documentation is NOT provided, and probably never will be. What I put in here will be largely affected by how much time I have available, and how relevant I find the information to be. Only things specific to GUIS will be put in here, meaning anything not GUIS-specific like Lua or the WoW addon environment will not be documented. It is assumed you are already familiar with those.

Please do not contact me with questions or requests regarding the GUIS libraries, modules and code in general. I will not answer any such requests. What I put in this folder, is the limit of what I'm willing to help with. 

I will update this folder on a regular basis, so you should expect the documentation to grow over time. I hope this will be of benefit to some of you!
